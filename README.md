# MTB-UNI v4 Firmware

This repository contains firmware for ATmega128 MCU for
[MTB-UNI v4 module](https://mtb.kmz-brno.cz/uni).

## Build & requirements

This firmware is developed in C language, compiled via `avr-gcc` with help
of `make`. You may also find tools like `avrdude` helpful.

Hex files are available in *Releases* section.

## Programming

Firmware could be programmed via programming connector on MTB-UNI module (ISP).
Warning: MTB-UNI contains bug: MISO & MOSI pins are not on programming connector,
they are placed on RS485 driver's pins. For programming v4.0 modules, please
remove RS485 driver and connect pins MISO & MOSI to appropriate pins. SCK,
RESET, VCC & GND could be connected via programming connector.

MTB-UNI v4.2 fixes this bug. For programming, please remove RS485 driver as it
uses same pins as are used for serial programming.

In future, firmware could also be upgraded directly via MTBbus.

This FW uses EEPROM, however no programming of EEPROM is required. There should
be just an empty EEPROM on fresh devices.

```bash
$ make
$ make fuses
$ make program
```

## Author's toolkit

Text editor + `make`. No more, no less.
